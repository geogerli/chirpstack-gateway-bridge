# Changelog

## v3.8.0

### Features

#### Multi-line meta-data commands

This makes it possible to let a meta-data command return multiple lines of
values. In case of multi-line output, ChirpStack Gateway Bridge will split
each line by a configured delimiter to obtain the key / value pairs.

### Bugfixes

* Fix race condition in Semtech UDP Packet Forwarder backend. ([#162](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge))

## v3.7.1

### Bugfixes

* Fix duplicated configuration in the Tektelic config example.
* Fix / improve ZMQ socket re-connect for Concentratord backend.

## v3.7.0

### Features

#### Concentratord backend

The [Concentratord](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/backends/concentratord/) backend is compatible with the
[ChirpStack Concentratord](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-concentratord)
daemon. Please note that this backend is experimental.

#### Syslog output

When `log_to_syslog` is enabled in the configuration file, the log output will
be written to syslog.

### Improvements

* Change MQTT max. reconnect interval default value to 1 minute.
* Refactor MQTT subscribe / unsubscribe logic.

### Bugfixes

* Use DevEUI object length instead of JoinEUI. ([#154](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/154))
* Remove default values for BasicStation filters. ([#157](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/issues/157))
* Fix BasicStation websocket ping loop. ([#156](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/issues/156))

## v3.6.0

### Features

#### Raw packet-forwarder events / commands

Using the raw packet-forwarder events and commands, it is possible to use the
[BasicStation Remote Command](https://doc.sm.tc/station/tcproto.html#remote-command)
and [BasicStation Remote Shell](https://doc.sm.tc/station/tcproto.html#remote-shell)
features.

#### Terminate on connect error

The `terminate_on_connect_error` will terminate the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge
process when it can't connect to the MQTT broker. In some cases this is
preferred over the retry loop.

### Improvements

#### FSK FDev

Before the frequency deviation was always set to the FSK `datarate / 2`. It
is now possible to set it manually (falling back on `datarate / 2` when unset).

## v3.5.0

### Features

#### MIPS builds

This is the first release providing binaries compiled for MIPS. These binaries
are compiled with `GOMIPS=softfloat` and are compressed with `upx` as MIPS
based gateways have usually limited storage space available. ([#65](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/issues/65))

#### RPM packaging

This is the first release providing .rpm packages for CentOS and RedHat. ([#145](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/145))

### Improvements

#### Environment variable configuration

The usage of `.` in environment variables for configuration has been deprecated
(it will continue to work, but will log a warning). Instead of `.`, use a
double underscore (`__`). ([#144](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/144))

#### Multiple MQTT servers

This release adds support for the configuration of multiple MQTT servers. ([#141](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/141))

## v3.4.1

### Bugfixes

* Fixes init stop script which could cause the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge to not properly stop or restart.

## v3.4.0

This release renames LoRa Gateway Bridge to ChirpStack Gateway Bridge.
See the [Rename Announcement](https://www.chirpstack.io/r/rename-announcement) for more information.

### Bugfixes

* Fix nested read lock. ([#139](https://github.com/brocaar/lora-gateway-bridge/issues/138))

## v3.3.0

### Features

#### Message IDs

This release implements unique message IDs (both for events and commands) that
can be used for correlation or logging purposes.

#### BasicStation channel-plan configuration

To make it easier to work with the [BasicStation](https://doc.sm.tc/station/)
Packet Forwarder, this release makes it possible to configure the channel-plan
inside the LoRa Gateway Bridge configuration file. It is no longer needed to
configure a Gateway Profile within LoRa App Server. This means that it is also
possible to use the LoRa Gateway Bridge with BasicStation gateways, without
the need of installing LoRa Server and LoRa App Server.

## v3.2.1

### Bugfixes

* Fix NetID 3 & 4 filter according to the [errata](https://lora-alliance.org/resource-hub/nwkid-length-fix-type-3-and-type-4-netids-errata-lorawan-backend-10-specification) published by the LoRa Alliance.
* Fix Basic Station bandwidth for LoRa Std channel (from kHz to Hz). ([#130](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/130))

## v3.2.0

### Features

#### NetID and JoinEUI filters

Configuration options have been implemented to filter uplink messages on netID
and JoinEUI. This makes it possible to ignore messages from neighboring
to save on bandwidth usage (e.g. when the gateway is using a cellular backhaul).

#### Execute commands

This feature makes it possible to execute commands on the gateway (when the
LoRa Gateway Bridge is running on the gateway). Note: commands must be
pre-configured in the LoRa Gateway Bridge configuration file.

### Improvements

#### Basic Station backend

* Verify Common Name when using client certificates. ([#129](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/129))

## v3.1.0

### Features

#### Azure IoT Hub X.509

X.509 certificate authentication is added to the `azure_iot_hub` MQTT
authentication option.

### Improvements

#### Prometheus metrics

The Prometheus metrics have been improved for consistency.
Documentation has been updated to document the metrics that are available.

#### Max reconnect interval

The MQTT max. reconnect interval is now a global MQTT configuration and can
be used regardless of the MQTT authentication type.

#### Lat / lon / alt = 0

When the latitude, longitude and altitude are all three `0`, then LoRa Gateway
Bridge assumes there is no GPS module / location available and it will not
expose a location in the stats message.

### Bugfixes

* The CRC check has been fixed for the Semtech UDP backend.
* Fix message buffering for QoS > 0 (on manual reconnect, the Paho library discards messages when offline).

### Deprecated

#### Managed gateway configuration

Documentation (and configuration) references to the managed
packet-forwarder configuration have been removed. The feature itself is still
available and will stay available until the next major release.
Please refer to [this forum discussion](https://forum.chirpstack.io/t/who-is-using-the-gateway-profile-how-are-you-using-it/5091)
for more background.

## v3.0.1

### Bugfixes

* Fix acquiring double read-lock (which could result in a deadlock). [#119](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/119)

## v3.0.0

### Features

#### Basic Station packet-forwarder support

The LoRa Gateway Bridge has been refactored to support multiple packet-forwarder
backends. Next to the Semtech UDP packet-forwarder, support has been added to
support the Basic Station packet-forwarder. This backend implements the 
[Basic Station LNS protocol](https://doc.sm.tc/station/tcproto.html).

#### Updated payload formats

The uplink payload contains a `context` field, used to store gateway
specific context data (like the internal counter).

The downlink frame contains a `timing` field which can be either
`IMMEDIATELY`, `DELAY` or `GPS_EPOCH`. Based on the `timing` value, an
additional object must be given with the additional timing information.
Refer to [Commands](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/payloads/commands/)
for more details.

#### Azure IoT Hub integration

LoRa Gateway Bridge now has support to connect the [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/)
MQTT interface. Like with the Google Cloud Platform IoT Core integration this
makes it easier to scale up and manage gateway credentials using the IoT Hub
console (or API).

#### Fake RX time

In case the gateway does not have a GPS module, the RX time would would be
left blank. This feature makes it possible to use the system time as a fallback.
([#109](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/109))

#### Custom gateway meta-data

This feature makes it possible to expose additional meta-data in the gateway
stats. Meta-data can either be static or dynamic (executing external commands).
The latter option allows to for example read and expose the gateway temperature,
humidity, ...

### Upgrading

LoRa Gateway Bridge v3.0.0 include a couple of changes that are not backwards
compatible. You need to re-generate the configuration file and update it where
needed. LoRa Gateway Bridge v3 is compatible with LoRa Server v2.7+.
Below a summary:

#### MQTT topics

The MQTT topic configuration has been updated from:

{{<highlight toml>}}
uplink_topic_template="gateway/{{ .MAC }}/rx"
downlink_topic_template="gateway/{{ .MAC }}/tx"
stats_topic_template="gateway/{{ .MAC }}/stats"
ack_topic_template="gateway/{{ .MAC }}/ack"
config_topic_template="gateway/{{ .MAC }}/config"
{{</highlight>}}

To:

{{<highlight toml>}}
event_topic_template="gateway/{{ .GatewayID }}/event/{{ .EventType }}"
command_topic_template="gateway/{{ .GatewayID }}/command/#"
{{</highlight>}}

Event types are: `up`, `stats` and `ack`.
Commands are: `down` and `config`.

Please note that LoRa Gateway Bridge v3 is compatible with LoRa Server v2.7+,
but you will need to update the MQTT topics in your `loraserver.toml` file.
Example snippet:

{{<highlight toml>}}
uplink_topic_template="gateway/+/event/up"
stats_topic_template="gateway/+/event/stats"
ack_topic_template="gateway/+/event/ack"
downlink_topic_template="gateway/{{ .MAC }}/command/down"
config_topic_template="gateway/{{ .MAC }}/command/config"
{{</highlight>}}

#### Backends

With LoRa Gateway Bridge v2 you would configure the MQTT backend under the
`[backend...]` section. This has changed and the `[backend...]` section is
now used for selecting and configuring the packet-forwarder backends.

#### Integrations

The MQTT integration configuration has moved to the new `[integration...]`
section. This allows for adding new integrations in the future besides MQTT.

#### Prometheus metrics

The Prometheus metrics have been updated / cleaned up.

## v2.7.1

### Bugfixes

* Fix `rxpk.brd` parsing for some packet-forwarders. ([#104](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/issues/104))

## v2.7.0

### Features

* Environment variable based [configuration](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/config/) has been re-implemented.

### Improvements

* Remove QoS > 0 bottleneck with non-blocking MQTT publish ([#101](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/101))

### Bugfixes

* Fix potential deadlock on MQTT re-connect ([#103](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/issues/103))
* Fix logrotate issue (init based systems) ([#98](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/98))

## v2.6.2

### Bugfixes

* Fix QoS backend setting regression. [#95](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/95)

## v2.6.1

### Bugfixes

* Fix corrupted gateway statistics for downlink packets. [#94](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/94)

## v2.6.0

### Features

#### Google Cloud Platform integration

LoRa Gateway Bridge is able to integrate with [Cloud IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot-core/).
This makes it easier to scale up, but also makes it possible to manage gateway
authentication using the web-based Cloud IoT console (or APIs).

#### Gateway IP address

The gateway IP address is exposed through the gateway stats.

## v2.5.1

### Bugfixes

Fix configuration parse error (some keys were not loaded because of configuration alias).

## v2.5.0

### Upgrade notes

When using the `v2_json` marshaler (default), this version is fully compatible
with previous versions of LoRa Server. When changing the marshaler to `protobuf`
or `json`, you first need to upgrade to LoRa Server v2.1.0. When
LoRa Server v2.1.0 is installed, it is recommended to use either the `protobuf`
or `json` marshaler as it provides better compatibility (e.g. with the iBTS gateway).

### Features

#### Protocol Buffer data serialization

To save on bandwith between the gateway and the MQTT broker (e.g. when the
gateway uses a cellular connection), this update makes it possible to
configure the `marshaler` for encoding / decoding the data (in
`chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml`) using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

This will become the default option in LoRa Gateway Bridge v3.

#### New JSON format

The new JSON structure re-uses the messages defined for
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)
based serialization. For backwards compatibility, the default `marshaler` for
LoRa Gateway Bridge v2.x will be `v2_json`. 

#### Kerlink iBTS fine-timestamp

When using the `protobuf` or `json` `marshaler`, LoRa Gateway Bridge will
expose the fine-timestamp fields when using Kerlink iBTS gateways.

#### Prometheus metrics

For monitoring the health and throughput of each LoRa Gateway Bridge instance,
LoRa Gateway Bridge is able to expose various metrics that can be scraped by
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

### Changes

#### Configuration structure of MQTT backend

The structure of the `[backend.mqtt]` configuration section has been updated.
These changes are fully backwards compatible.

### Improvements

All vendored dependencies have been updated.

## 2.4.1

**Bugfixes:**

* Only log in case of UDP read / write errors (instead of breaking out of loop).

## 2.4.0

**Features:**

* LoRa Gateway Bridge can now manage the packet-forwarder configuration (channels).
  See [Send / receive data](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/use/data/) for more information.

## 2.3.2

**Improvements:**

* Expose the following MQTT options for the MQTT gateway backend:
  * QoS (quality of service)
  * Client ID
  * Clean session on connect

**Bugfixes:**

* Use topic from configuration file on re-connect (this was still hardcoded).

## 2.3.1

**Improvements:**

* MQTT topics are now configurable through the configuration file.
  See [Configuration](https://docs.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/config/).

## 2.3.0

**Features:**

* LoRa Gateway Bridge uses a new configuration file format.
  See [configuration](https://docs.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/config/) for more information.

* Support MQTT client certificate authentication ([#74](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/pull/74)).

**Upgrade notes:**

When upgrading using the `.deb` package / using `apt` or `apt-get`, your
configuration will be automatically migrated for you. In any other case,
please see [configuration](https://docs.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/config/).

## 2.2.0

**Features:**

* LoRa Gateway Bridge now publishes TX acknowledgement messages over MQTT.
  See [MQTT topics](https://docs.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/use/data/).

* TX (GPS) `timeSinceGPSEpoch` field is now exposed to transmit at given
  time since GPS epoch (1980-01-06, only possible when the gateway
  has a GPS time source).

* RX (GPS) `timeSinceGPSEpoch` field is now exposed, containing the time
  since GPS epoch (1980-01-06, only available when the gateway has a GPS
  time source).

**Bugfixes:**

* Without GPS time source, the gateway would use `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`
  as RX `time`. The `time` field is now omitted when unavailable.


## 2.1.6

**Features:**

* Add Kerlink iBTS compatibility (multi antenna and multi board).

## 2.1.5

**Improvements:**

* `--mqtt-ca-cert` / `MQTT_CA_CERT` configuration flag was added to
  specify an optional CA certificate
  (thanks [@minggi](https://github.com/minggi)).

**Bugfixes:**

* MQTT client library update which fixes an issue where during a failed
  re-connect the protocol version would be downgraded
  ([paho.mqtt.golang#116](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang/issues/116)).

## 2.1.4

* Retry connecting to MQTT broker on startup (thanks @jcampanell-cablelabs).
* Make latitude, longitude and altitude optional as this data is not always
  provided by the packet_forwarder and would else incorrectly be set to `0`.

## 2.1.3

* Provide `TXPacketsReceived` and `TXPacketsEmitted` in stats.
* Implement `--skip-crc-check` / `SKIP_CRC_CHECK` config flag to disable CRC
  checks by LoRa Gateway Bridge.

## 2.1.2

* Add optional `iPol` field to `txInfo` struct in JSON to override the default
  behaviour (which is `iPol=true` when using LoRa modulation)

## 2.1.1

* Do not unmarshal and marshal PHYPayload on receiving / sending
* Set FDev field when using FSK modulation ([#16](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/issues/16))
* Omit empty time field ([#15](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/issues/16))

## 2.1.0

* Support protocol v1 & v2 simultaneously.

## 2.0.2

* Rename from `lora-semtech-bridge` to `chirpstack-gateway-bridge`

## 2.0.1

* Update `lorawan` vendor to fix a mac command related marshaling issue.

## 2.0.0
